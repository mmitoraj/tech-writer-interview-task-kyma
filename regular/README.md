# Overview

The purpose of this task is to give you a glimpse of what technical writers in Kyma do and what tools they use. You get a chance to play with the software you are going to write about and learn more about the underlying technology.

## Task

### Step 1

Fork this repository and create a new file in the `task` folder. Name the file after your GitHub user name. The file must have a  `.md` extension. For example, `jacktorrance.md`.
Write all of the required content in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and save it in the file you created.

## Step 2

Access the Kyma cluster prepared for the recruitment process. Use the provided credentials.

>**NOTE:** The password and email are encoded with base64. Decode the credentials before use.

## Step 3

Explore the Kyma cluster. Create a ClusterRoleBinding and bind the **your_initials_recruitment** group to the **kyma-edit** ClusterRole. Create a step-by-step instruction for users that want to achieve this exact goal. Introduce the instruction with an `H2` heading.

When writing the instructions, follow the [Kyma guidelines for creating content](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/master/guidelines/content-guidelines), the [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), and reference the writing style seen on [kyma-project.io](https://kyma-project.io/docs/) to create a piece that could become a part of product documentation.

>**TIP:** Use the **Preview changes** option in the GitHub UI or an external Markdown editor, such as [jbt.github.io](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) to check if your Markdown displays correctly.

## Step 4

Kyma and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) rely heavily on Namespaces. Conduct research and create a short definition of what a Namespace is. In your definition include an example that illustrates how users can use Namespaces in their implementations. Introduce the definition with an `H2` heading.

## Step 5

Create a pull request to this repository.


## Expected outcome

The expected outcome is a [pull request](https://github.com/Writers-Instagram/tech-writer-interview-task/pulls) with a single file that contains all of the required content.
